				<h2>AFK - Game Development Symposium</h2>
				
				<p>
					<div class="title">Design Concept: </div>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The AFK (Away From Keyboard) game development symposium is an event designed to provide a platform for passionate SIAT
					undergraduates with game design focus to showcase their work to an industry audience. Throughout the school term, students
					were encouraged to submit their game projects to one of the four event categories:
				</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Narrative</li>
					<li>Immersion</li>
					<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
					<li>Level Design</li>
				</ol>

				</section>
				
				<p>
					From each category, one project was selected as represenative in front of a panel of four Vancouver games industry judges,
					as well as the attendees mixed of students, industry professionals and school faculty memebers. The attendees were also invited
					to the post-event mixer for a chance to network with the local game industry professionals and jumpstart their careers. In addition
					to student projects, AFK symposium also featured two talks delivered by SIAT PhD faculty. The postgraduate talks focused on academic
					researches involving expanding video games beyond tradional entertainments.

				<div class="title">My roles in AFK</div>
					<p>
						In both planning and running the event, I took on the role of event planner and technology officer. I was approached
						by Sean Warwick, who initialized the idea to create AFK based on TouchPoint, a similar design conference held at SFU
						focusing on user experience design. I joined the AFK organization committee as I was fond of the idea to give back to
						the university and provide a platform to assist newcomers in the program. I was involved in choosing of representatives
						from each category and provided comments and assisted presentators on how to present during the event to ensure the highest
						quality possible. On the day of the	event, I was in charged of technology equipments required for the conference - that
						includes and not limited to, making sure the selected projects will operate fine on the projectors, the amount of microphones
						and the sound and lightings of the venue.

				<div class="title">Outcome</div>
					<p>
						Overall, I believe the AFK organization commitee did great. Considering that it was our first iternation of the event, it was 
						highly successful. We had a total of 110 tickets sold, with roughly 70 attendees attending the day of the event. The panelists
						included representatives from successful studios including: East Side Games, Roadhouse Interactive, Relic Entertanment, IUGO Mobile
						Entertainment. We were also happy to feature an opening talk by Dave Fracchia from the Centre of Digital Media. Perks for attendees
						included door prizes totalling $175 in value as well as catered breakfast, lunch and dinner.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Due to the highly positive reception, the SIAT event planning staffs plan to continue partnership with us to develop AFK into an annual event
						with full support. To ensure that the event reamins a student led initiative, we have invited some of the presenters to take over as next year's
						organization committee. I will instead take on a supporting mentor role to provide guidances when needed.
