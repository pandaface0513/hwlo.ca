				<h2>Anatroc - A Virtual Reality Puzzle Adventure</h2>
				
				<p>
					<div class="title">Design Concept: </div>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Anatroc is an immersive virtual reality puzzle adventure created for the Archiact Interactive Global Game Jam.
					Designed to test player's exploration skills, visual memory, and navigation skills as players explore the winding
					pathways of the maze. Decipher clues to uncover hidden pathways and perhaps even an exit. The original design of
					Anatroc was to create an immersive virtual reality experiences with two players cooperating with one another. 
					To achieve this, the team researched the existing titles for Google Cardboard virtual reality headset. We foundo out
					that while there are a few PvP multiplayer games exist, but there were no cooperative multiplayer virtual reality titles
					available. We wanted to design Anatroc as the first cooperative multiplayer virtual reality experiences. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In its completion, Anatroc became a first person maze exploration game with both players taking uniqe roles. One player would
					take on the role of the maze avatar and would be forced to navigate the game's maze. The other palyer would take on the role of
					the first player's navigational AI. This player cannot move but has full access to a map of the maze. This map displays both players'
					locations and maze's doors and exit. Anatroc's gameplay will be formed through verbal communication between the two players in order
					to complete the maze. Both players are required to exchange clues in order to proceed in game levels. For example, the maze player will
					communicate a hint back to the AI player, for the AI player to unlock hidden doorways for maze player to explore. This game concept is
					based on numerous real-life escape room games in Vancouver, which I have personally researched on.

				<div class="title">My roles in Anatroc</div>
					<p>
						In Anatroc, I took on the role of the lead programmer. For my first step in developing the game, I started to experiment with
						the Google Cardboard SDK with Unity. I was responsibe for majority of the game mechanics found in the maze. This includes but
						not limited to the movement mechanic, raycasting mechanic, real-time minimap mechanic. I also used the scene loader to minimize 
						the loads the device has to do. The experience was very valuable, as I learned in the progress, that it is much different to
						to design a game for desktop versus design a game for mobile. As mobile devices are not as powerful or as resourceful traditional
						computers, virtual reality games for mobile requires much delicate attentions to details. I spent several days finding ways to 
						optimise Anatroc to run in reasonable framerates for mobile phones. I also worked with another programer in collaboration to create
						the virtual reality experiences.

				<div class="title">Outcome</div>
					<p>
						As a result Anatroc was selected as one of the 20 game jam finalists from over 100 individual submissions.
						We also finished in 4th place in the "player's choice" voting portion of the contest. In reflection I maintain
						that it was the right decision to redesign Anatroc as a single player game given the time contraints.
						However, our team agree that Anatroc would have been a much more interesting and immersive experience with the
						multiplayer gameplay aspect intact. In summary I felt that competing in this game jam was a valuable experience
						in learning to design in virtual reality, and also in completing a project under a strict deadline. Perhaps it would
						be worth while to reapproach it.
